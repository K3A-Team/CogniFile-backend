# Intelligent File Management System Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for an advanced file management system developed during the A2SV Hackathon. Our solution aims to address common file management challenges and introduce intelligent features for enhanced user experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Intelligent Chatbot Assistant**: Interacts with users and can read file contents
- **Natural Language Search**: Supports multiple languages and voice input
- **Automatic File Categorization**: Tags files based on content (e.g., financial, marketing, studies)
- **Automatic File Hierarchy Suggestion**: Proposes optimal file organization structures
- **Duplicate File Detection**: Identifies and manages duplicate files
- **Local Deployment Option**: Ability to deploy the application on local infrastructure
- **Version Control Detection**: Automatically detects version information from file names

## 🛠️ Additional Features

- Automatic file translation
- Data backup capabilities
- Malicious file detection
- Advanced file search (image content, voice, etc.)
- File correction (fonts, spelling)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integration with PC file systems

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Clone the repository , install the requirements by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Initialize a firestore database and storage.
- Provide a .env file with your credentials and a firebase.json file in the same folder as the main file
- After this you can directly start the API by using `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- FastAPI: For building the API.
- Firestore: As the database solution.
- Firebase Storage: For file storage.
- Elastic Search: For advanced search capabilities.
